# Fibonacci Generator using Tkinter

A simple Tkinter-based application for generating Fibonacci series up to a specified term.

## Overview

This Python script utilizes the Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface for generating Fibonacci series. Users can input the number of terms they want in the series, and the application will display the generated series in a new window.

## Features

- User-friendly Tkinter GUI.
- Efficient Fibonacci series generation using recursion.
- Clear display of the generated series in a separate window.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Fibonacci Generator:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. If not, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   cd your-repo
   ```

### Usage

1. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python fibonacci_generator.py
   ```

2. The Tkinter window will appear, prompting you to enter the number of Fibonacci series terms.

3. Click the "Get" button to generate the series.

4. A new window will display the generated Fibonacci series.
